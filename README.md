# Connect Four
 
This is a quick Final Project for CPSC 411 - creating a Connect Four application.  Created by Nancy Badillo.

## Functionality
* The Connect Four board is currently at 4 columns with 6 rows.
* The application will alternate between players (red and yellow).

## Known Issues
* The circles spawn in the middle of the button collection, instead of the top of the button collection.
* The game currently does not detect win or lose conditions.
